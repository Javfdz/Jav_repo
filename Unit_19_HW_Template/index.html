        <h1>Javaier Fernandez Flota</h1>
        <p>I am a UX UI designer and have 10 years in the beauty and banking industries.

          I enjoy looking at things such as an app and imagining opportunities to be improved upon and work proactively to solve problems.
          
          As a stylist and banker I have developed empathy as a skill set which allows me to understand other people's pain points easily.
          
          My Ideal client is someone who is hands on and open to new ideas and opinions.
